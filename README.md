## Our mini-project about Chrome Extension of Floating Screen
Multi-tasking has become an integral part of people’s lives. Working simultaneously on
numerous tasks has become a daily habit of everyone’s day to day lives, and fairly enough,
since people do a lot of tasks in a single day, it becomes a useful skill to manage
everything. People often shuffle through different windows while working on their
desktops, which may often lead to errors. Hence, developing such a tool which can offer a
floating screen where the user can manage multiple things at the same time is essential.
Hence why, the same has been facilitated in the form of an extension, as it’s the best tool to
deploy a product for making browsing experience on a web browser more efficient.
